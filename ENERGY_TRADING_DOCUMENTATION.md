## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **EnergyOrder**
```rust
pub struct EnergyOrder {
    pub id: OrderId,
    pub trader: AccountId,
    pub order_type: OrderType, // Buy or Sell
    pub energy_amount: EnergyAmount, // In centi-kWh (100 = 1 kWh)
    pub price_per_kwh: PricePerKwh, // In deci-milliwatts (10000 = 1 WATT)
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub is_active: bool,
    pub filled_amount: EnergyAmount,
}
```

#### 2. **EnergyTrade**
```rust
pub struct EnergyTrade {
    pub id: TradeId,
    pub buyer: AccountId,
    pub seller: AccountId,
    pub energy_amount: EnergyAmount,
    pub price_per_kwh: PricePerKwh,
    pub total_cost: Balance,
    pub grid_fee: Balance,
    pub final_cost: Balance,
    pub timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub buy_order_id: OrderId,
    pub sell_order_id: OrderId,
}
```

#### 3. **Prosumer**
```rust
pub struct Prosumer {
    pub address: AccountId,
    pub name: String,
    pub energy_generated: EnergyAmount,
    pub energy_consumed: EnergyAmount,
    pub is_active: bool,
    pub registered_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub prosumer_type: ProsumerType,
}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Register as a Prosumer

```rust
use pallet_energy_trading::{EnergyTradingSystem, ProsumerType};

let mut energy_trading = EnergyTradingSystem::new(config);

// Register Alice as a residential prosumer
energy_trading.register_prosumer(
    "alice".to_string(),
    "Alice Solar Home".to_string(),
    ProsumerType::Residential
)?;
```

### 2. Record Energy Generation/Consumption

```rust
// Alice generates 50 kWh of solar energy
energy_trading.generate_energy("alice", 5000)?; // 5000 centi-kWh = 50 kWh

// Bob consumes 30 kWh
energy_trading.consume_energy("bob", 3000)?; // 3000 centi-kWh = 30 kWh
```

### 3. Place Trading Orders

```rust
use pallet_energy_trading::OrderType;

// Alice places a sell order: 20 kWh at 0.95 WATT per kWh
let sell_order_id = energy_trading.place_order(
    "alice".to_string(),
    OrderType::Sell,
    2000, // 20 kWh in centi-kWh
    9500, // 0.95 WATT per kWh in deci-milliwatts
    &mut token_system
)?;

// Bob places a buy order: 15 kWh at 1.0 WATT per kWh
let buy_order_id = energy_trading.place_order(
    "bob".to_string(),
    OrderType::Buy,
    1500, // 15 kWh in centi-kWh
    10000, // 1.0 WATT per kWh in deci-milliwatts
    &mut token_system
)?;
```

### 4. Cancel Orders

```rust
// Cancel an active order
energy_trading.cancel_order("alice", &sell_order_id, &mut token_system)?;
```

### 5. Check Market Statistics

```rust
let stats = &energy_trading.statistics;
println!("Active buy orders: {}", stats.buy_orders_count);
println!("Active sell orders: {}", stats.sell_orders_count);
println!("Total trades: {}", stats.trades_count);
println!("Total energy traded: {} kWh", stats.total_energy_traded as f64 / 100.0);
```

## Configuration

### EnergyTradingConfig

```rust
pub struct EnergyTradingConfig {
    pub grid_fee_rate: u32,          // Grid fee in basis points (500 = 5%)
    pub min_order_size: EnergyAmount,    // Minimum order size (100 = 1 kWh)
    pub max_order_size: EnergyAmount,    // Maximum order size (100000 = 1000 kWh)
    pub min_price_per_kwh: PricePerKwh,  // Minimum price (100 = 0.01 WATT)
    pub max_price_per_kwh: PricePerKwh,  // Maximum price (100000 = 10 WATT)
    pub order_expiry_blocks: BlockNumber, // Order expiry time (86400 blocks â‰ˆ 1 day)
    pub market_open: bool,               // Whether market is open for trading
}
```

### Default Configuration

```rust
impl Default for EnergyTradingConfig {
    fn default() -> Self {
        Self {
            grid_fee_rate: 500,        // 5%
            min_order_size: 100,       // 1 kWh
            max_order_size: 100000,    // 1000 kWh
            min_price_per_kwh: 100,    // 0.01 WATT
            max_price_per_kwh: 100000, // 10 WATT
            order_expiry_blocks: 86400, // ~1 day
            market_open: true,
        }
    }
}
```

## Integration with Token System

The Energy Trading Pallet integrates seamlessly with the Token System Pallet:

### 1. **WATT Token Payments**
- All energy trades are settled in WATT tokens
- Automatic token transfers between buyer and seller
- Grid fees are automatically deducted and burned

### 2. **Escrow System**
- Buyer's WATT tokens are held in escrow when placing buy orders
- Tokens are released upon trade completion or order cancellation
- Prevents double-spending and ensures trade security

### 3. **Grid Fee Collection**
- Grid fees are calculated as a percentage of trade value
- Fees are automatically deducted and burned from circulation
- Supports sustainable grid infrastructure funding

## Events

The system emits events for all major operations:

```rust
pub enum Event {
    ProsumerRegistered { address: AccountId, name: String, prosumer_type: ProsumerType },
    EnergyGenerated { address: AccountId, amount: EnergyAmount },
    EnergyConsumed { address: AccountId, amount: EnergyAmount },
    OrderPlaced { order_id: OrderId, trader: AccountId, order_type: OrderType, energy_amount: EnergyAmount, price_per_kwh: PricePerKwh },
    OrderCancelled { order_id: OrderId, trader: AccountId },
    OrderPartiallyFilled { order_id: OrderId, filled_amount: EnergyAmount, remaining: EnergyAmount },
    OrderFilled { order_id: OrderId, trader: AccountId },
    TradeExecuted { trade_id: TradeId, buyer: AccountId, seller: AccountId, energy_amount: EnergyAmount, price_per_kwh: PricePerKwh, total_cost: Balance },
    GridFeeCollected { trade_id: TradeId, fee_amount: Balance },
    MarketPriceUpdated { new_price: PricePerKwh },
}
```

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling for all operations:

```rust
pub enum EnergyTradingError {
    ProsumerAlreadyRegistered,
    ProsumerNotFound,
    OrderNotFound,
    TradeNotFound,
    InvalidEnergyAmount,
    InvalidPrice,
    InsufficientWattBalance,
    InsufficientEnergyAvailable,
    SelfTrading,
    OrderNotActive,
    OrderAlreadyCancelled,
    Unauthorized,
    MarketClosed,
    TokenSystemError(String),
}
```

## Unit Conversions

The system uses precise internal representations for energy and price:

### Energy Amount
- **Internal**: `EnergyAmount` (u64) in centi-kWh
- **Conversion**: 1 kWh = 100 centi-kWh
- **Range**: 0.01 kWh to 184,467,440,737 kWh

### Price per kWh
- **Internal**: `PricePerKwh` (u64) in deci-milliwatts
- **Conversion**: 1 WATT = 10,000 deci-milliwatts
- **Range**: 0.0001 WATT to 1,844,674,407 WATT per kWh

### Utility Functions

```rust
// Convert between kWh and internal representation
pub fn kwh_to_energy_amount(kwh: f64) -> EnergyAmount;
pub fn energy_amount_to_kwh(amount: EnergyAmount) -> f64;

// Convert between WATT tokens and internal price representation
pub fn watt_to_price(watt: f64) -> PricePerKwh;
pub fn price_to_watt(price: PricePerKwh) -> f64;

// Calculate costs with grid fees
pub fn calculate_energy_cost(
    energy_amount: EnergyAmount, 
    price_per_kwh: PricePerKwh, 
    grid_fee_rate: u32
) -> (Balance, Balance, Balance); // (base_cost, grid_fee, total_cost)
```

## Testing

The pallet includes comprehensive test coverage:
