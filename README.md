# üåü Decentralized Energy Trading Ecosystem

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive **Decentralized Energy Trading Ecosystem** as outlined in the blueprint "Forging the Digital Grid: A Blueprint for a Decentralized Energy Trading Ecosystem". The system enables peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading between prosumers (producers + consumers) using blockchain technology and a dual-token economic model.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The system is built on several key components:

### 1. **Blockchain Foundation** (`blockchain.rs`)
- Custom blockchain implementation with energy-focused transaction types
- Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism (adaptable to NPoS for production)
- Energy-specific balance tracking and validation
- Smart contract execution environment

### 2. **Energy Trading Market** (`energy_trading.rs`)
- Continuous Double Auction (CDA) order matching engine
- Real-time P2P energy trading between prosumers
- Dynamic grid fee calculation and collection
- Order book management with price-time priority

### 3. **Dual-Token Economic Model** (`token_system.rs`)
- **GRID Token**: Utility and governance token for platform access and staking
- **WATT Token**: Fiat-pegged stablecoin for energy transactions
- Staking rewards and governance mechanisms
- Mint/burn operations for stablecoin stability

### 4. **Transaction Types** (`block.rs`)
- **Energy Trade**: P2P energy exchanges between prosumers
- **Grid Fee**: Payments to grid operators for infrastructure usage
- **Token Staking**: Network security and governance participation
- **Governance Vote**: Decentralized decision-making

## üöÄ Key Features

### **P2P Energy Trading**
- Direct energy trading between prosumers without intermediaries
- Automatic order matching based on price-time priority
- Grid-aware fee calculation for infrastructure usage
- Real-time market price discovery

### **Dual-Token Economics**
- **GRID ($GRID)**: Governance and utility token
  - Staking for network security (8% annual yield)
  - Platform access licensing for Application Hosts
  - Governance voting rights
  - Fee discounts and incentives

- **WATT ($WATT)**: Stable unit of account
  - 1:1 peg with local fiat currency
  - Exclusive medium for energy transactions
  - Fully collateralized with fiat reserves
  - Seamless fiat on/off ramps

### **Prosumer Management**
- Energy generation and consumption tracking
- Net energy calculation and settlement
- Token balance management
- Trading history and analytics

### **Market Mechanisms**
- Continuous double auction for optimal price discovery
- Order book with buy/sell order management
- Trade matching and execution
- Grid fee calculation and distribution

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Built with Rust**
- High-performance, memory-safe blockchain implementation
- Concurrent order matching engine
- Cryptographic security with SHA-256 hashing
- Serialization support for network communication

### **Dependencies**
- `chrono`: Timestamp handling and date operations
- `sha2`: Cryptographic hashing for block validation
- `serde`: Serialization for data structures
- `uuid`: Unique identifier generation

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ installed
- Cargo package manager

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd ledger

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run the demo
cargo run
```

### Demo Output
The demo creates a realistic energy trading scenario:
1. **Setup**: Creates prosumers (Alice's Solar Farm, Bob's Wind Turbine, Charlie's Home)
2. **Energy Generation**: Alice generates 50 kWh solar, Bob generates 30 kWh wind
3. **Energy Consumption**: Charlie consumes 25 kWh
4. **Token Funding**: Users receive WATT tokens via fiat on-ramp
5. **Market Orders**: Prosumers place buy/sell orders
6. **Trade Execution**: Orders are matched and executed automatically
7. **Blockchain Settlement**: Transactions are recorded on the blockchain
8. **Final Balances**: Display updated token and energy balances

## üìä Usage Examples

### Creating a Prosumer
```rust
let mut alice = Prosumer::new(
    "alice_address".to_string(), 
    "Alice's Solar Farm".to_string()
);
alice.generate_energy(50.0); // 50 kWh solar generation
```

### Placing Energy Orders
```rust
// Sell order: 20 kWh at $0.15/kWh
let sell_order = EnergyOrder::new(
    "alice_address".to_string(),
    OrderType::Sell,
    20.0,
    0.15,
);
energy_market.place_order(sell_order).unwrap();
```

### Token Operations
```rust
// Mint WATT tokens (fiat on-ramp)
token_system.mint_watt_tokens("alice_address", 100.0).unwrap();

// Stake GRID tokens for rewards
token_system.stake_grid_tokens("alice_address", 1000.0).unwrap();
```
